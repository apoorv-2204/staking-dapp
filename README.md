# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test


npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

{
    "stakingAddress": "0xFA26a6Cf45689Bf7b4d6Ef72b5898343ed4A4a5f",
    "rewardTokenAddress": "0x52249D502a67e99A14061D7D9174F567aA398FED"
}
